# RecipeBox
RecipeBox is a full-stack web application built with RedwoodJS that allows users to share and browse recipes. Users can create an account, post their favorite recipes, and search for recipes by title, description, and ingredients. The application includes user authentication, CRUD operations, social sharing, and accessibility features.

## Features
* User Authentication: Allow users to create an account, log in, and log out. Only authenticated users can create new recipes, edit their own recipes, and delete their own recipes.

* Recipe CRUD: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete recipes. Each recipe has a title, a description, a list of ingredients, and a set of instructions for how to prepare the dish.

* Search and Filter: Allow users to search for recipes by title, description, and ingredients. Also, allow users to filter recipes by cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Indian).

* Social Sharing: Allow users to share recipes on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

* User Profiles: Each user has a profile page where they can see all the recipes they have posted, as well as their personal information like name, email, and profile picture.

* Accessibility: The website is designed with accessibility in mind, with appropriate headings, alt text for images, and keyboard navigation.
